      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring front-end developer with a big passion in building
        modern user interfaces. I admire simplicity and believe in building
        products and tools that meet user's needs. I have a perfectionist nature
        and love honing my deliverables until I feel like it can't be
        realistically improved anymore. Aesthetic and fluid designs are always
        what I strive to achieve, always putting UX at the forefront.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very experienced with React and Next.js, putting them as the
        primary tools I reach out for. Over years, I have accumulated an immense
        amount of knowledge in my domain and I still keep finding new things to
        learn and master. The learning process gives me joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also keep track of latest tech updates and stay relatively active in
        the community by following and engaging with the industry leaders on X
        and YouTube. I am always keen to try out new tools and learn new lessons
        from their approaches to certain problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, I was also a very active member of competitive programming
        community. Having been introduced to competitive programming at the age
        of 12, I have always liked challenging myself and my friends to solve
        harder and harder puzzles. This competitive drive has led me to success
        and a wide range of achievements. I have been at IOI (International
        Olympiad in Informatics) thrice, as a participant in 2019 and 2020 and
        as a deputy leader in 2022. I continued participating in ICPC during my
        university years and contributed to big competitions as a problemsetter
        and translator.
