      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring front-end developer with a big passion in designing and
        developing modern user interfaces. I admire simplicity and believe in
        building products and tools that meet user's needs. I have a good eye
        and very high attention to details. I love building quality products and
        often try to hone my deliverables until I feel like it can't be
        realistically improved anymore. Aesthetic and fluid designs are always
        what I strive to achieve, always putting UX at the forefront.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very experienced with React and Next.js, putting them as the
        primary tools I reach out for. I like to think of front-end as picking
        the best tools for the job and assembling them together in harmony,
        similar to solving a big big puzzle. Over the years, I have accumulated
        a lot of knowledge in my domain, but I still keep finding new things to
        learn and master. I also try to keep my knowledge of fundamentals like
        CSS and vanilla JavaScript up to date with latest standards and best
        practices. The learning process gives me joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep track of latest tech updates and stay relatively active in the
        community by following and engaging with the industry leaders on X and
        YouTube. I am always keen to try out new tools and analyze their
        innovative approaches to solving problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in programming stems from my early school days, when I was
        solving a lot of competitive programming problems. You can read more
        about that <a href="/competitive-programming">here</a>.
